# Phase_4_Project

## Description
For this project I created a movie recomendation system using the MovieLens data set.

I built and used the SVD model using the surprise package and got a powerful prediction score of FCP 93%

Going forward I plan to incorporate content based filtering to solve for the cold start problem, and if i can build a hybrid model for optimal results.
